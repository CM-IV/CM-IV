My name is Charlie and I am fascinated with Computer Science.

I am interested in web development particularly involving TypeScript or Go, and I tend to focus most of my time here.

- ðŸ”­ I have recently attained my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science with a Minor in Mathematics. 
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on applications involving Node APIs with relational DBs, implement data structures to help improve speed and reliability of code, or help with DevOps Adminstration.
