My name is Charlie and I am fascinated with Computer Science.

I am interested in web development involving TypeScript and systems development with Rust - I tend to focus most of my time here.

- ðŸ”­ I have recently attained my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science with a Minor in Mathematics. 
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m currently learning Rust.
